To participate in IJCAI DC 2021, two video introductions are prepared for my work. They are available to preview here:

- 2 min: https://recorder-v3.slideslive.com/?share=46221&s=4ac6d13b-a0aa-477b-8724-f049b9af685b
- 15 min: https://recorder-v3.slideslive.com/?share=45992&s=aa31d710-29ab-44ce-9747-8ff5b60bbc1f

We also have a 2-page paper submitted. It is available on:

> **Abstract**: We propose Dr.Aid, a logic-based AI framework for automated compliance checking of data governance rules over data-ﬂow graphs. The rules are modelled using a formal language based on situation calculus and are suitable for decentralized contexts with multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) processes. Dr.Aid models data rules and ﬂow rules and checks compliance by reasoning about the propagation, combination, modiﬁcation and application of data rules over the data ﬂow graphs. Our approach is driven and evaluated by real-world datasets using provenance graphs from data-intensive research.
