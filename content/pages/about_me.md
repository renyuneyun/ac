Title: About me

I'm Rui Zhao, a Post-doc at the Department of Computer Science, University of Oxford. I work for the [EWADA (Ethical Web And Data Architecture in the Age of AI)](https://ewada.ox.ac.uk/) project, at the Human-Centred Computing group, with Sir Nigel Shadbolt and Sir Tim Berners-Lee.

Prior to this, I obtained my PhD from [AIAI](http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/aiai), School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh, supervised by Prof. Malcolm Atkinson, Dr. Petros Papapanagiotou and Dr. Jacques Fleuriot. My thesis title was: Dr.Aid: A formal framework assisting
compliance with data governance rules.

My current work mainly involves improving the privacy and empowering users of data use in the decentralised data architectures like [SoLiD](solidproject.org/). That also bridges back with my PhD work on modelling and reasoning of data-use policies in decentralised contexts.

See [my research]({filename}research.md) page for a more detailed description.

## Beyond research

Apart from research, I'm an open-source contributor. See [this page](https://me.ryey.icu/projects/) for a coarse summary.

Apart from computing, I enjoy reading and exploring mental boundaries, and I can play some [Guqin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guqin).
