My topic focuses on modelling data-use policy (data-governance rules) to make them interpretable by machines, and to perform automated reasoning on data flow graphs to check compliance and to derive downstream data-use policies.

See [my research]({filename}research.md) page for a more detailed description.  
See [here for my CV]({static}/pdfs/CV_public.pdf).

## Other than research

Apart from my PhD research, I'm an open-source contributor. See [this page](https://me.ryey.icu/projects/) for a coarse summary.  
Want a highlight? Try [Easer](https://github.com/renyuneyun/Easer) on your phone: Easer is an user-defined explicit automation app for Android.

Apart from computing, I enjoy reading and exploring mental boundaries, and I can play some [Guqin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guqin).
