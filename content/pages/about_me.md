My topic focuses on modelling data-use policy (data governance rules) to make them interpretable by machines while understandable by humans, and performing automated reasoning on data flow graphs to check compliance.

See [my research]({filename}research.md) page for a more detailed description. See [here for my CV]({static}/pdfs/CV_public.pdf).
